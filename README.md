🔒 Simple Password Manager
This is a Python-based password manager that securely stores and retrieves passwords using Fernet encryption from the cryptography module.

📌 Features:
Encryption: Passwords are encrypted before storing in password.txt.
Decryption: Encrypted passwords are decrypted when viewed.
User-Friendly: Simple CLI-based interaction.
Persistent Storage: Data is saved in password.txt for later use.

🚀 How It Works:
Key Generation:

The program loads the encryption key from key.key.
If the key is missing, you must generate it manually (See Setup).
Adding a Password:

The user enters an account ID and password.
The password is encrypted and stored in password.txt.
Viewing Stored Passwords:

The stored encrypted passwords are decrypted and displayed in plain text.
Exit:

Users can quit the program anytime by entering 'q'.


📂 File Structure:
/Password-Manager
│── key.key            # Stores encryption key
│── password.txt       # Stores encrypted passwords
│── password_manager.py # Main Python script
│── README.md          # Project documentation


🛠 Setup Instructions:
1️⃣ Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required package:
pip install cryptography

2️⃣ Generate Encryption Key (First-Time Setup)
Uncomment and run this function in the script:

"from cryptography.fernet import Fernet"

"""
def key_generation():
    key = Fernet.generate_key()
    with open('key.key', 'wb') as key_file:
        key_file.write(key)
    print("Encryption key generated successfully.")
                                                """
key_generation()  # Run this once to create key.key
This will generate key.key, which is required for encryption/decryption.

3️⃣ Run the Program
Execute the script:
python password_manager.py



📌 Usage Instructions:
1️⃣ Add a Password
pgsql
Copy
Edit
Would you like to add a Password or View the Password (view|add) or 'Q' to Quit: add
Enter User Account ID: example@gmail.com
Enter the Password: mysecurepassword
✅ Password saved successfully!

2️⃣ View Stored Passwords
pgsql
Copy
Edit
Would you like to add a Password or View the Password (view|add) or 'Q' to Quit: view
user: example@gmail.com | password: mysecurepassword

3️⃣ Exit the Program
pgsql
Copy
Edit
Would you like to add a Password or View the Password (view|add) or 'Q' to Quit: q

⚠️ Security Considerations:
Do not share key.key, as it is required to decrypt passwords.
Use a secure storage solution like a password-protected directory for sensitive files.
Do not store passwords in plaintext—this script ensures encryption.
